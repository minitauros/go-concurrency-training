This repository contains a number of courses with exercises to practice different concepts in Go. Each course itself
contains a number of directories that contain an exercise to be done. Each exercise directory has its own README with
instructions.

## Prerequisites

In order to perform the exercises, you will need the following:

* Go >=1.24
* An IDE or text editor to edit Go files in.

If you are running iOS and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, simply run the following:

```
brew install go
```

## AI help

AI is super useful to ask for help. However, if you ask it to solve the exercises for you, you will probably not learn
as much as when you solve them yourself. My recommendation is that you first try to solve the exercises yourself,
before asking AI. At least think about it for a moment, and if you really don't know how to start, use AI, or even just
a good old internet search engine (like Google). It may be smart to disable AI line completion while you do these 
exercises.

Some exercises mention in their README what specific things you could ask AI about so that it will give you the info you
need to solve the exercise, without the AI solving it for you.
