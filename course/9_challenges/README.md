This directory contains a bunch of problems that I encountered while trying to build a concurrent consumer from scratch. Each directory contains a _problem_ and a _solution_ directory. 

## How to use these challenges

To get the most out of this, first open the first _problem_ directory. Read the readme and see if you can figure out a solution to the problem. Perhaps you want to modify the code in the _problem_ directory to see if you can engineer a solution; all fine! Heck, maybe you can even run it if you're feeling adventurous. 

Then, when you're ready, open the solution and see if you reached the same conclusion as I did. 

## Disclaimer

My solution may not be the best, nor the only solution. I came up with what you see in this repository while trying to build a concurrent Kafka consumer from scratch just for the sake of this course.
