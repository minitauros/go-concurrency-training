Imagine that in the `default` case of the loop in `Start()` a message is fetched from Kafka. At that very second `Stop()` is called, which closes the work channel to send a signal to all goroutines to stop working. However, since the program is running concurrently, the routine that just fetched a message from Kafka is going to send it on the work channel. This will cause a panic, because you cannot send anything on a closed channel.
